Whether reasoning about something deeply technical or attempting a quick computation, moving with the same focus or nimbleness that I had, say five or ten years ago, feels harder. It’s time to hit the gym.Project Euler is one of many options for a brain workout. I chose it because the problems are fun to solve and the process is different enough from my normal work that it feels like a break. And I miss doing math.I’ll be sharing solutions here. To start, here it is for problem 1:SolutionWe compute the sums of multiples of 3 and 5, then subtract the double-counted numbers, which are the multiples of 15. Each term is an arithmetic series which can be evaluated by $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k = \\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$$ This gives us$$3 \\sum_{k=1}^{333} k + 5 \\sum_{k=1}^{199} - 15 \\sum_{k=1}^{66}k = 233168$$",
